  "description": "This dataset contains _simulated_ influenza vaccine coverage data in fall-winter 2023-2024. The data provides weekly cumulative coverages by state and adult and child age groups. Estimates are based on the reported coverage of the flu vaccine in the 2021-2022 fall season by month, state, and age. We used a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial to generate weekly coverage estimates from monthly data. Dates have been shifted to reflect projection weeks in the 2023-2024 season. The data in this file can be used as is (no adjustment to coverage should be needed). Age groups can be collapsed based on provided population sizes.",
