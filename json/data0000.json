  "description": "This dataset provides state-aggregated data for __hospital utilization__ in a timeseries format dating back to _January 1, 2020_. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15). After _Friday September 29th, 2023_, as a result of changes in reporting cadence, this dataset will be updated twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.",
